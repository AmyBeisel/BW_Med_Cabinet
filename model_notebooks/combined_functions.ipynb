Its undocumented origins result in this strain being labeled as indica, sativa, and everything in between, but its effects are most commonly described as hybrid-like in its balanced calm and moderate cerebral effects. Saturn OG\\u2019s forest green buds are lit by a constellation of crystal trichomes, and this OG Kush relative is often lumped into a \\u201cplanetary strain\\u201d series that includes Earth OG and Jupiter OG. The psychoactive onset of Saturn OG begins with an intense burst of euphoria that fades to smooth relaxation perfect for relieving stress and muscle tension.\\u00a0\"\n",

This odoriferous combination speaks volumes through its scent, which is thick with soured earth and a hint of pepper on the finish. The herbaceous terpene profile aligns nicely with this strain\\u2019s intense relaxation and moderate cerebral effects.

This strain from Jordan of the Islands is quite possibly named for its bluish accents and starry coat of white crystal trichomes. Cerebral energy balanced by an indica calm create a comfortable psychoactive experience conducive for creative and social activities. Berry overtones tinged with a sour skunk aroma build a complex flavor profile for the small dense buds. Sapphire Star, with a flowering time of 7 to 8 weeks, grows to a towering 15 feet outdoors and up to 6 feet in indoor gardens.\\u00a0\"\n",

A flavorful medley of sweet grape, earthy pine, and spicy pepper build the complex aroma of LAPD\\u2019s compact crimson and purple buds. Small to moderate doses induce a mellow, cerebral euphoria that sinks down to the rest of the body in a full physical calm. According to its breeders at California Bean Bank, LAPD\\u2019s abbreviated name appropriately describes these variable effects: \\u201cto protect and serve, or to take you out.\\u201d LAPD is typically chosen by patients treating pain, cramps, stress, and fatigue.
